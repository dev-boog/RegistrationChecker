NISSAN NV200 SE DCI - 2012 - 87bhp 
Gains information
Stage 1
Stage 2
Stage 3
| Stock | Tuned | Gains  
---|---|---|---  
Power (bhp) | 87 | 110 | + 23  
Torque (nm) | 200 | 245 | + 45  
Data not held Stage 2 +£119 to booking
Unfortunately, we have not had this vehicle tested on our rolling road for stage 2 figures.
However, most vehicles see another 15-30bhp and 20-40nm depending on the engine and modifications.
In most cases, stage 2 requirements are: upgraded downpipe (including GPF removal for GPF cars), upgraded intercooler and upgraded intake.
We do not provide installation services for parts, so please ensure these are fitted prior to arrival.
Woah there, cowboy! Stage 3 Custom Tuning Session +£799 to booking
Due to the nature of a stage 3 tune (and stages above), we are unable to provide accurate figures without knowing the modifications you've made to your car.
In most cases, stage 3 and above is where forced induction has been upgraded or added. Such as a hybrid turbocharger.
Please note, all stage 3 builds require custom tuning sessions on our dyno. You can book your custom tuning session by clicking the 'Book Online Now' button and following the steps. Just make sure to add the 'Custom Tuning Session' extra along the way.

Stage 2 remap upgrade designed for cars with 'breathing' modifications.
Unless we have stage 2 figures on the reg lookup results page, we cannot quote you exact gains.
Typically, most vehicles see an additional 15-30bhp and 20-40nm on a stage 2 tune (on top of stage 1 figures).
Please do not call us and ask for gains, we cannot give them to you unless they're already on the website result page.
(Typically) requires the following modifications:
  * Upgraded intercooler
  * Sports cat or decat downpipe
  * Upgraded intake


We do not fit or supply parts, currently. You must, therefore, make sure these modifications have been fitted prior to your appointment. If you do not have these modifications, you can't have a stage 2 tune.
